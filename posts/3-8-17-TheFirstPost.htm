    <p>Well, I suppose you should always have a post like this when (re)starting such a thing. Though honestly this thing will probably just be as unused as my last blog; that is, of course, unless I actually find something interesting to sink my time into writing about. Maybe i'll finally start writing about my plans for JMP3D, possibly an article or two about emulation (which I still need to get better at). The future can hold many things for this blog, and hopefully one of them isnt being closed.</p>

    <p>Regardless of all of this, I hope to actually use this blog at some point, because I feel there is some things I can actually talk about now. Hopefully I will.</p>
