Setting this up was not fun at first. Maybe later I’ll write a little something about the hellish experience that was attempting to set up Jekyll and eventually giving up due to a <a href=\"http://help.rubygems.org/discussions/problems/33671-suggestion-for-easy-solution-for-the-ipv6-related-timeout-problem\">known error with Gem and (apparently) ipv6</a>. Considering Jekyll is what is <em>reccomended by github for blogging</em>, this is a bit of an annoyance, but since you’re reading this it obviously is not the only way of getting things done.</p>\n<p>Regardless, I’m hoping that now that I have a setup (thanks to Gatsby.js and Kyle Mathews) I will actually do more. Wonder if this sort of posting thing will become a yearly occurance. Something completely new to me is React.js which Gatsby.js uses, so it’s going to be an interesting learning experience if I decide I want to really add a lot of things to this blog.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Lets Try This Again, Again","date":"January 13, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/lets-try-this-again/","previous":null,"next":null}}
