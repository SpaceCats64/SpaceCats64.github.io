Setting this up was not fun at first. Maybe later I’ll write a little something about the hellish experience that was attempting to set up Jekyll and eventually giving up due to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.rubygems.org/discussions/problems/33671-suggestion-for-easy-solution-for-the-ipv6-related-timeout-problem&quot;&gt;known error with Gem and (apparently) ipv6&lt;/a&gt;. Considering Jekyll is what is &lt;em&gt;reccomended by github for blogging&lt;/em&gt;, this is a bit of an annoyance, but since you’re reading this it obviously is not the only way of getting things done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, I’m hoping that now that I have a setup (thanks to Gatsby.js and Kyle Mathews) I will actually do more. Wonder if this sort of posting thing will become a yearly occurance. Something completely new to me is React.js which Gatsby.js uses, so it’s going to be an interesting learning experience if I decide I want to really add a lot of things to this blog.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
